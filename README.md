# PIDtoolbox

PIDtoolbox is a GUI-based set of Matlab tools for analyzing Betaflight blackbox log files. The motivation behind the development of this
tool was to create a user-friendly GUI-based tool for comparing two flights. This came after a realization of the way FPVers often tune 
and/or troubleshoot miniquads: "Run test flight 'A', make subjective assessment of flight performance, tweek some parameters, run test 
flight 'B', make subjective comparison between A and B, re-tweek", and so on. PIDtoolbox compares two test flights across multiple flight
variables.
