# PIDtoolbox

PIDtoolbox is a GUI-based Matlab tool for analyzing Betaflight blackbox log files. The motivation behind the development of this
tool was to create a user-friendly, objective, method for comparing two flights. This came after a realization of the way FPVers often troubleshoot an issue with flight performance (e.g., vibrations, mid-throttle oscillation, etc): "Run test flight 'A', make subjective assessment of flight performance, tweek some parameters, run test flight 'B', make subjective comparison between A and B, re-tweek", and so on. PIDtoolbox is designed around A/B testing, with an emphasis on spectral analysis and PID error.
