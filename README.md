# PIDtoolbox

PIDtoolbox is a GUI-based Matlab tool for analyzing Betaflight blackbox log files.

The motivation behind the development of this tool was to create a user-friendly, objective, method for comparing between flights. This came after a realization of the way we often troubleshoot an issue with flight performance (e.g., vibrations, mid-throttle oscillation, propwash oscillation, etc). A typical scenario goes something like "run test flight 'A', make subjective assessment of performance, tweak parameters, run test flight 'B', make subjective comparison between A and B, re-tweak", and so on. The problem with this approach from a scientific standpoint is that it lacks objectivity and reliability. Subjective bias becomes particularly problematic when the differences between A and B are subtle. PIDtoolbox was designed with this in mind.

I am not an engineer, and what I know about control theory has only come from my experience with miniquads over that past 3-4 years. So for engineer types out there, PIDtoolbox may seem like a slightly unconventional approach to PID analysis. That said, I am a Neuroscientist with about ~15ys experience and publishing on the neural basis of oculomotor control, which believe it or not has a close resemblance to the flight characteristics of miniquads. I also study neuronal oscillations, hence the focus on spectrograms. PIDtoolbox was partly inspired by Plasmatree PID-analyzer (https://github.com/Plasmatree/PID-Analyzer), and the goal was to extend some of that type of functionality here in a GUI-based program.

Over the past year or so, there has been increasing emphasis on advanced gyro and dterm filtering, particularly in the +150Hz range, and this has led to amazing improvments in flight characteristics. During that time I have been analyzing many blackbox log files in Matlab and noticed a consistent difference between copters that fly well and copters that do not, specifically in the 30-100Hz spectrum, which can often be seen in |PID error| during steadly-state flight. Most commanded copter motion is below ~20Hz (even if you're a Mr. Steele on the sticks, at best you might push this to 25-30Hz!), but from my analyses, activity between 30-100Hz tends to correlate with the kind of vibes we SEE during flight and in HD video (things like mid-throttle oscillation, propwash, jello, etc.). Although these frequencies cannot be filtered out, the goal of PIDtoolbox is to use it as an objective comparative measure between A/B testing to help decide whether changes between A-B tests (in software settings, hardware, mechanical, or otherwise) were effective. I will show some examples that support this idea.

That said, below is everything you need to begin using PIDtoolbox. I hope you find it useful, and I would really appreciate feedback from the FPV community.

# Download

There are a couple of ways you can download PIDtoolbox. 

1) If you have Matlab, you can simply download the repository of mfiles, place them in a folder, and run PIDtoolbox.m from the Matlab command prompt. You will need Signal Processing Toolbox installed for this to work.

2) If you do not have Matlab, you can download a standalone Windows version. You must first install Matlab runtime (MATLABÂ® Compiler Runtime, MCR), which then allows you to run any standalone Matlab program.

Steps:

(i) Install Matlab runtime <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html" target="blank">(Matlab-runtime)</a> for Windows (64bit only, version 9.3 R2017b). Unfortunately, this will likely not work for Windows 32bit users, but you could try the next most appropiate version for your Windows machine, at your own risk. I have not tested this extensively across multiple versions of Windows, so your feedback here will be very helpful. I will continue to provide updates in this regard so stay tuned. The good news is this is a one-time installation, after which you can run any Matlab standalone!

(ii) Download PIDtoolbox for Windows here:
<a href="https://github.com/bw1129/PIDtoolbox/releases" target="blank">(PIDtoolbox.zip)</a> Unzip and place entire folder in your preferred location on your computer. For Mac/Linux/others, if you have a bonafide copy of Matlab and can create your own standalone version of PIDtoolbox, I'd be great if you upload it here!

(iii) Run 'PIDtoolbox.exe', found in folder: 
'PIDtoolbox\for_redistribution_files_only\PIDtoolbox.exe'
NOTE: PIDtoolbox.exe and other files must remain in this folder.

If you have issues installing Matlab runtime, or running PIDtoolbox, please give feedback here:

# How to use:

PIDtoolbox will import .bbl, .bfl, or .csv files, but there are a few things you need to know: 

(i) Optional: If you wish to use .bbl or .bfl files directly, you will need to have a copy of 'blackbox_decode.exe' in the same directory as your .bbl/.bfl files. 'blackbox_decode.exe' is part of Betaflight/cleanflight blackbox-tools, and can be downloaded here:
<a href="https://www.github.com/betaflight/blackbox-tools" target="blank">(Betaflight Blackbox-tools)</a>

(ii) Recommended: Use .csv files! BUT NOTE, you MUST convert your .bbl or .bfl file to a .csv file using Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer. Save as .csv from there please! Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer can be downloaded here: 
<a href="https://www.github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer/releases" target="blank">(Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer)</a>

Now, let's get on with a few examples:

## 1) Mid-throttle oscillations
'Glen' posted a log file (A) to the Betaflight BlackBox Log Review Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/291745494678694/?ref=bookmarks" target="blank">(Betaflight BlackBox Log Review Facebook group)</a>
describing a vibration issue. He then made some changes to the PIDs and filters and reposted a second log file (B).
