# PIDtoolbox

PIDtoolbox is a GUI-based Matlab tool for analyzing Betaflight blackbox log files from multirotors.

The motivation behind the development of this tool was to create a user-friendly, objective, method for comparing between flights. This came after a realization of the way we often troubleshoot flight performance issues (e.g., vibrations, mid-throttle oscillation, propwash oscillation, etc). A typical scenario goes something like "run test flight 'A', make subjective assessment of performance, tweak parameters, run test flight 'B', make subjective comparison between A and B, re-tweak", and so on. The problem with this approach from a scientific standpoint is that it lacks objectivity and reliability. Subjective bias becomes particularly problematic when the differences between A and B are subtle. PIDtoolbox was designed with this in mind.

I am not an engineer, and what I know about control theory is limited to my 3-4 year experience with multirotors. So for engineer types out there, some aspects of PIDtoolbox might seem unconventional, and I welcome your feedback. That said, I'm a neuroscientist with about ~15ys experience publishing research on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bjw112968/" target="blank">neural basis of oculomotor control</a>, which believe it or not has a lot of similarities to the flight characteristics and data associated with multirotors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEqraYeP7Qs" target="blank">(e.g.)</a>. PIDtoolbox was also inspired by Plasmatree PID-analyzer (https://github.com/Plasmatree/PID-Analyzer), and one of the goals was to extend some of that type of functionality here in a GUI-based program.

Over the past year or so, there has been increasing emphasis on advanced gyro and dterm filtering in flight controller software, particularly around the ~200-500Hz range associated with motor vibration, which has led to amazing improvments in flight characteristics. During that time I have analyzed a lot of Betaflight blackbox log data in Matlab and noticed a consistent difference between copters that fly well and copters that do not, specifically in the 30-90Hz range. Most commanded copter motion is below ~20Hz (even if you're a Mr. Steele on the sticks, at best you might push this to 25-30Hz!), but from my analyses, elevated activity in the 30-90Hz range tends to correlate with the kind of vibrations we SEE during flight and in HD video (things like mid-throttle oscillation, propwash, jello, etc.). Although these frequencies cannot be filtered out, the goal of PIDtoolbox is to use this as an objective comparative measure for A/B testing, to help decide whether the use of different software/hardware/mechanical/etc settings between A-B tests are effective. I will show some examples that support this idea.

Below is everything you need to begin using PIDtoolbox. I hope you find it useful, and I would really appreciate feedback from the FPV community.

Cheers!

# Download

There are a couple of ways you can download PIDtoolbox. 

**1)** If you have Matlab, you can simply download the repository of mfiles, place them in a folder, and run PIDtoolbox.m from the Matlab command prompt. You will need Signal Processing Toolbox installed for this to work.

**2)** If you do not have Matlab, you can download a standalone Windows version. You must first install Matlab runtime (MATLABÂ® Compiler Runtime, MCR), which then allows you to run any standalone Matlab program.

**Steps:**

**(i)** Install Matlab runtime <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html" target="blank">(Matlab-runtime)</a> for Windows (64bit only, version 9.3 R2017b). Unfortunately, it will likely not work for Windows 32bit users, but you could try the next most appropiate version for your Windows machine, at your own risk. I have not tested this extensively across multiple versions of Windows, so your feedback here will be very helpful. I will continue to provide updates in this regard so stay tuned. The good news is this is a one-time installation, after which you can run any Matlab standalone!

**(ii)** Download PIDtoolbox for Windows here:
<a href="https://github.com/bw1129/PIDtoolbox/releases" target="blank">(PIDtoolbox.zip)</a> Unzip and place entire folder in your preferred location on your computer. For Mac/Linux/others, if you have a bonafide copy of Matlab and can create your own standalone version of PIDtoolbox, and It would be greatly appreciated if you could upload it here!

**(iii)** Run 'PIDtoolbox.exe', found in folder: 
'PIDtoolbox\for_redistribution_files_only\PIDtoolbox.exe'
NOTE: PIDtoolbox.exe and other files must remain in this folder.

If you have issues installing Matlab runtime, or running PIDtoolbox, please give feedback here:

# How to use

PIDtoolbox will support .bbl, .bfl, or .csv files, but there are a few things you need to know: 

**(i)** If you wish to use .bbl or .bfl files directly, you will need to have a copy of 'blackbox_decode.exe' in the same directory as your .bbl/.bfl files. 'blackbox_decode.exe' is part of Betaflight/cleanflight blackbox-tools, and can be downloaded here:
<a href="https://www.github.com/betaflight/blackbox-tools" target="blank">(Betaflight Blackbox-tools)</a>

**(ii)** My recommendation is use .csv files! BUT NOTE, you MUST convert your .bbl or .bfl file to a .csv file using Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer. Save as .csv from there please! Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer can be downloaded here: 
<a href="https://www.github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer/releases" target="blank">(Betaflight Blackbox-log-viewer)</a>

Now, let's get on with a few examples:

### E.G. (i) Mid-throttle oscillation
'Glen' posted a log file (A) to the Betaflight BlackBox Log Review Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/291745494678694/?ref=bookmarks" target="blank">(Betaflight BlackBox Log Review Facebook group)</a>
describing a vibration issue with his copter. He then made some changes to the PIDs and filters and reposted a second log file (B). 
At a glance (see below), the post filtered Gyros (right panels) looked clean in test flights A (upper) and B (lower). 
![](images/PIDtoolboxGUIexample2b.png)

I then selected the specrograms to compute sub-100Hz throttle x freq plots for set point and PID error, then hit 'refresh' (see below). I know, you're thinking "why are you plotting set point?" Since Set point is RC input in deg/s, the freq spectrum of set point is a good measure of the range of frequencies associated with commanded motion. Theoretically then, anything above this is uncommanded motion (e.g., mid-throttle oscillations, propwash, etc.). The horizontal dashed lines on the spectrograms delineate this region (which, incedentally corresponds with the cutoff used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2MZOaHJFMAmW5ni7vuAQg" target="blank">UAVtech's</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jCIJ2FKL7t-ZADcErNrZOcWfWtkgSVdr" target="blank">filter Calc Tool</a>. Now, when we look at the PID error spectrum (right panels), we see a clear band of activity around 40-50Hz in the mid-to-upper throttle range, mainly on roll and pitch for test A, and less so for test B (despite the fact that the full spectrum looked clean for both!). To corroborate this, we can see bursts of oscillation in the Gyro and PID error traces blown up on the left, with peaks ~22ms apart (which is 45Hz!). I would argue then that the degree of activity within ~30-90Hz range should be a good indicator of a copter's actual performance, though more testing is required.  
![](images/PIDtoolboxGUIexample2c.png)

To go a little further, we can plot the mean absolute value of PID error as a function of throttle (see below). For these plots, we constrain analysis to a portion of the data in which RC input was at a minimum (see max stick window in GUI), since we know PID error gets much larger during fast rolls/flips. Again, the results corroborate our previous observations. From these results, we can conclude that the adjustments made in test B are a significant improvement from test A. We are on the right track!

### E.G. (ii) Propwash
This past summer I was asked by Mark Spatz (UAVtech) to compare propwash handling between 1k and 8k pid loop rates, on the same copter with identical settings with the exception that the 1k setup did not have the dynamic notch active. Thus, the 1k setup had a minor disadvantage in terms of potentially more motor-related noise, but also an advantage of having slightly lower total phase latency (3.01ms vs 3.71ms for A vs B, respectively, abbreviated PsD-A and PsD-B in the lower portion of the control panel of PIDtoolbox), which is computed directly in PIDtoolbox via cross correlation between unfiltered and filtered gyro and dterm. I posted an HD video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbx--JI01NE" target="blank">(Propwash Video Test)</a> of both flights on the Rotor Riot Facebook group, and then polled observers to decide which one showed less propwash in a blind test. Turns out people chose test (1). See if you can guess which one that corresponds to in the following analysis of both flights:
![](images/PIDtoolboxGUIexample1b.png)

In this case we are just plotting the spectrograms (Test A left and Test B right). Here we are plotting sub-100Hz PID error and motor sigs 1 and 2. Test A shows less activity in the 20-90Hz window in both PID error and the motor 1-2 signals. For test B, there is a bigger 'blob' of activity above the red 'commanded motion' line, indicative of more propwash. Incidentally, it turns out that flight (1) in the video corresponds to Test A here. It's also worth noting that these spectrograms are normalized such that they are largely unaffected by the length of the file/flight, which makes it more of an apples-to-apples comparison between A and B. This result shows the novelty and value of being able to plot spectrograms across different kinds of blackbox data.
